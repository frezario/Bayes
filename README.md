# Bayes classifier
- We created a simple multinomial naive Bayes classifier and conducted an
analysis of it. We found out how P&S can help us to come up with a
solution to a problem that can't be solved using ordinary methods. 
We've also covered possible applications of Bayes' formula in real life and
learned how to classify objects using the naive Bayes principle.
- The most difficult thing was to prevent the problem of "zero" probability,
due to which the total conditional probability of our tweet belonging
to a certain class could become zero. The main problem, though, was not the
complexity of the task itself, but the limitations in the use of tools - 
honestly, the R language did not prove to be helpful in completing the task.
Not least because its syntax is practical and does not conform to modern 
program design standards.
